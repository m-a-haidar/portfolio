      Hi, I’m Muhammad Ali Haidar!
      I am currently pursuing my PhD in Berlin. My research focuses on understanding the neural circuits and mechanisms behind sleep profiles and how neuromodulators regulate these behaviors. With experience in both preclinical and basic research, I bring a broad perspective to exploring complex scientific questions. I’m also fascinated by neurotechnology’s potential to bridge biology and innovation, driving new tools and insights to transform how we understand the brain.

      Beyond the lab, I’m dedicated to science communication and blending science with literature to make complex ideas engaging and relatable. If you’re interested in neuroscience, neurotech, or the art of storytelling in science, let’s connect!

          I am part of a research group dedicated to exploring the origins of individuality in behavior using Drosophila melanogaster as a model organism. My project focuses on understanding the neural mechanisms underlying individual variability in sleep patterns and circadian rhythms.

          My tasks include behavioral analysis, advanced microsopy, and machine-learning based data analysis.

          My work focused on investigating the neuroprotective effects of Mitoquinone (MitoQ) in a mouse model of traumatic brain injury (TBI). As a Graduate Teaching Assistant for Cellular Metabolism and Protein Biochemistry, I supported lab sessions, assisted with grading, and developed teaching materials. I enhanced student engagement by creating detailed lab guides, streamlined grading with efficient feedback, and adapted to hybrid teaching during the COVID-19 pandemic, helping improve student outcomes and confidence.
