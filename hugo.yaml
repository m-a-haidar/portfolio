          My master’s thesis focused on investigating the neuroprotective effects of Mitoquinone (MitoQ) in a mouse model of traumatic brain injury (TBI). The study demonstrated that MitoQ improved neurological outcomes, reduced neuroinflammation, and enhanced cognitive and sensorimotor functions by targeting oxidative stress and inflammation pathways. Key findings included improved cognitive performance, reduced brain edema, and preserved neuronal integrity, highlighting MitoQ’s potential as a therapeutic for TBI.

          As a Graduate Teaching Assistant for Cellular Metabolism and Protein Biochemistry, I supported lab sessions, assisted with grading, and developed teaching materials. I enhanced student engagement by creating detailed lab guides, streamlined grading with efficient feedback, and adapted to hybrid teaching during the COVID-19 pandemic, helping improve student outcomes and confidence.

          Techniques and Skills:

            - Behavioral Assessments: Conducted comprehensive testing, including the Garcia neuroscore, grip strength, adhesive removal, object recognition, and Morris water maze tests, to assess motor, cognitive, and neurological functions.
            - Molecular Analysis: Utilized RT-qPCR for gene expression analysis, focusing on the Nrf2-ARE antioxidative pathway, and performed immunofluorescence staining to evaluate neuroinflammation and neuronal integrity.
            - Data Interpretation: Analyzed complex data sets to elucidate the relationship between oxidative stress modulation and improved neurological outcomes, contributing to a deeper understanding of TBI pathology.
            - Teaching and Course Development: Demonstrated complex concepts through interactive lab sessions. Contributed to the design of new experiments and updated teaching materials to reflect current research.
